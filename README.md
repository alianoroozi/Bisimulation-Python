# Bisimulation-Python
 Computing strong and weak bisimulation equivalence classes of a graph (transition system) using NetworkX package of Python.
 
 The code constructs a transition system using explicit model files. It then applies Kanellakis Smolka algorithm to compute strong bisimulation and Groote Vaandrager algorithm to compute weak (stutter) bisimulation equivalence classes.
